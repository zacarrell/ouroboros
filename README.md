Ouroboros
=========

These are a collection of functions and scripts to interact with the 
APIs on the Ouroboros family of websites.  Current functionality allows 
users to download posts to their local and catalog posts by keywords or 
tags.  More functionality is coming in the future.

(This project is currently unlicensed because the good licenses take 
more time to read than the scripts do.  Why even bother?)
